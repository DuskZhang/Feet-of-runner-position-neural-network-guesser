# Feet-of-runner-position-neural-network-guesser

This project is a fully connected neural network capable of guessing the x and y of one foot if given the x and y of another within a coordinate plane of size(1260,2160).
The coordinates beyond 1000 are strange, since I never trained beyond that point in training sets, but other than that, if one were to run the nnpredict.py in a python environment capable of running programs, you can guess a feet position using an x and y.

Additionally, if one were to run the runnernn.py, they would see the graph of the man running in addition to the predicted coordinates of the man's feet while running.
